The Mobile/iOS Game May Be Retconned

2022-05-19 17:27:01,391 - 
So I have read Avatar: Adapt or Die today and I had some
thoughts about it in regards to the Avatar lore. I strongly
suspected that this comic would feature Sylwanin and that it would
address some of the past content that featured her, namely the
Mobile/iOS game, which had some interesting plot points in it to
say the least. I'm going to go over why I think this game has been
retconned from canoninity.

Here is the timeline of the Avatar universe in regards to Grace
as follows.

Grace has been on Pandora for 15 years. She says that
she put 10 years of her life into the schoolhouse, meaning
she had been on Pandora for 5 years at the time of
Avatar: Adapt or Die.
Where this gets interesting is that at the start of the comic,
it says, over a decade after t…

Avatar on the Nintendo DSi

2022-05-19 17:27:01,407 - 
I recently managed to get my hands on the Nintendo Power Issue
246. There's an article about James Cameron's Avatar games there. I
came upon this nugget of info that on the Nintendo DSi enhanced
version Nok can get a new character model when completing a bonus
mission with the DSi enhanced mode. Does any fans own this version
of the game, would love to see this outfit.

The Avatar Problem

2022-05-19 17:27:01,409 - 
I decided to make a post about this for no other reason than to
have it addressed, as I find it very interesting. Discussion
welcomed and encouraged.
There are two given explanations for how the avatars in the
Avatar universe are created in the first place, both of
which pretty starkly contradict each other.

The first is the one we hear and see used in the film and most
other canon material. "They grow them from human DNA mixed with
the DNA of the natives". This explanation presumes that
scientists literally mix the DNA of humans with the DNA of Na'vi to
create a hybrid creature - and thusly avatars are most commonly
referred to as "hybrids". Some genetic manipulation is involved in
the process but this method asserts that avatars have a
percen…

The Story of James Cameron - Blockbuster Podcast

2022-05-19 17:27:01,416 - 
The second season of the award-winning Blockbuster
podcast tells the story of James Cameron's rise from humble
beginnings as a delivery truck driver to prolific filmmaker
and master of technical innovation.
I'm a big fan of the first season -- it focused on George Lucas
and Stephen Spielberg -- and I'm just as impressed with Season 2 so
far. 
Thought it may be of particular interest to the Avatar Wiki
community, so here's a link to check it

Mr. Cameron has gifted to us. Maybe we could build onto lore about
the human factions and other RDA-controlled planets.

I assume you're having fun with my previous post, "my Ideas as
they are now" and are looking for this new post. well, this is
it.
so far, I've got one of the Character sheets already made, and
that leads to an interesting question, why am I making them?
it's simple, I keep a copy of all character sheets and how they
interact, that way I can put this all into a nice and neat list in
my head. I've got one player currently (looking for a group of up
to 6, max. minimum of 4). as well, for that player, I'm making the
Exosuit more details, and removing other options if I can get
around to it. I'll also do a nice little section for the
Exosuit.

the human race is similar to the D&D game (the raci…

2022-05-19 17:27:01,431 - 
those are the words of a minorly famous quote no one has heard
of. they seem rather apt for this post.
I am Reaper, and I am a general creator. specifically, I love
taking movies, games, and general ideas floating through my head,
and then consider them in three frames of mind. videogame,
tabletop, story. the Story is always the most important part, as it
contains the basic premise of the entire game. the Videogame is my
ideas for how it should be played as a videogame, including PC
interaction with NPC's, how to save, minute details all the way to
huge details.
and so, when I saw avatar, it really kickstarted my ideas. a
universal theme, with a sci-fi feel that could very well be a
Fantasy game in and of itself.
I like stuff like that, be it…

What started my Avatat interest

2022-05-19 17:27:01,433 - 
When i first seen the avatar movie in 2019 i suddenly was
inspired by it, seeing the beautiful connections the Na'vi has with
thier planet, a both Spiritually and Neuralogicly advanced race,
which i found amazingly Beautiful just like Doctor Grace Augestine
was. Also the advanced technology the humans aka the RDA had, the
avatar movie was what officailly pulled me into loving the Sci-Fi
genre, and eventually involving other major sci fi frachises.
Im in the process of creating a RP universe composed of all my
favorite Sci-Fi movies and games along with some of my own added
stuff. It is known as the Null Alliances Universe.

My Movie Review

2022-05-19 17:27:01,435 - 
Avatar is a movie that would explore the world of
glowing plants and animal as well as blue-skinned humanoids called
Na'vi. Glowing land plants and fungi are the most stunning element
of the film. That is what so cool about the nights if I was on
Pandora. It makes me think it would be tremendously cool for people
to have those in the backyards back on Earth, well artificially
made fake ones using solar energy. In real life, glowing plants and
fungi are mainly found underwater on Earth, but land bioluminescent
organisms is likely more common on other worlds, just like on this
world relative to Earth in this film. The world I'm talking about
is Pandora, which is actually a moon that orbits around a gas

Na'vi Written Language

2022-05-19 17:27:01,442 - 
I've seen this concept art related to Avatar movie several
times, but for some reason I've dismissed it as fan art, and never
paid much attention to it. Eventually I was able to find such an
image with the Weta watermark, which raised it to official status.
But I still dismissed it as a abandoned concept, since the Na'vi
Language page tells us that they have no written language.

But in my latest re-watch of Avatar, I noticed this concept image
inside the Old School House. As shown on the right image. Does this
mean that the Na'vi have some kind of rudimentary symbol system
(pictographs) predating the writing system?

Markings on the Weta rendering of the Eytukan bow. Markings on a

It appears the long-awaited sequel to 2009's Avatar is *finally*
heading into production! ComingSoon.net reports that principal
photography for Avatar 2 is set to begin sometime this April, once
again in New Zealand. James Cameron will of course direct, from a
script by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and all the main characters
are to be reprised by the original stars - Sam Worthington, Zoe
Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang. No official release
date has been set thus far, but there is confirmation that three
sequels continues to be the plan for the franchise. What are your
thoughts on this development? Are you optimistic that the wait will
finally be over sooner than later?

Ever since the Ubi shut down the game servers, I've searched for
info on how to get access to the unlocked weapons and armors we
had. I think the files should be on our computer but somewhere in
the code it says you need to connected to the server to see them,
since it's user-based, or something like that. Is there a way to
tell to the game I'm connected, while in reality I'm not. But it
seems that since it's considered a bad game by the majority, the
hackers and crackers are not interested in it also.
The unlocks were the following:

Sad indeed. An unexpected accident in California; James Horner
died in a plane crash. He was alone in a small private aircraft;
and was a trained pilot. He was 61.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33235271
What is perhaps rather eerie is that in his last interview in
April, when asked about his continued involvement with the
franchise he said "If I last that long".[1]
A great shame in any case; he will be missed by many.

Hey folks. While doing some digging to find information about
AVTR Advanced Team I discovered that another flash game was made at

simulator. We totally missed it! It was done with McDonalds and the
site is down (its been like five years), but i came across a
back-up on someone's art portfolio website!

I believe the game was launched on Dec 11 2009, at the same time
as the other flash game. Notably, each time you investigate an item
it adds a log to the 'notes section', which quickly becomes
somewhat of a wiki itself. There is a wealth of information in
there for the site. I have also made a local back-up of the opening

Joe Letteri Says Avatar Sequels Are The Most Ambitious Projects They've Worked On

2022-05-19 17:27:01,471 - 
It's been five long years since Avatar wowed audiences
all around the world. Unfortunately, we still have to wait till
2016 to get the first of three planned sequels. Sounds like a long
time? Don't panic! The closer we are to the release, the more
production details we get! The hyping and build-up makes the
experience even more exciting.
Now, WETA's Digital Joe Letteri has opened up a little bit on
what he considers the biggest challenge the studio has ever had:
the Avatar sequels. Not only are they pushing the boundaries in
terms of technology (again), they are creating the most detailed
universe they can to achieve an unparalleled level of realism.
Exciting things are coming!

A water ride showcasing Pandora's native fauna and flora
A flying simulator, where guests can “discover what it feels
like to soar into the sky riding a Banshee”
A walk through a bioluminescent jungle
The existing “Tree of Life” will be redecorated to look more
like Hometree

Avatar novel(s) in the making

2022-05-19 17:27:01,501 - 
Good news for those who are still waiting for the Avatar novel
that we were promised about three years ago. James Cameron has not
forgotten about it. As you may have read here, James Cameron hired
four screenwriters for the upcoming three films.
He now also hired sci-fi author Steven Charles Gould to write
not one but four stand-alone Avatar novels. Gould has written eight
novels so far. His best known novel is Jumper which was made
into a film of the same name in 2008. He is president of the
Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, an
association of professional sci-fi and fantasy authors with about
1800 members.
Here is what James Cameron had to say: “Steven Gould is one
of the shining lights in contemporary science fiction, and I’ve

The Mobile/iOS Game May Be Retconned

2022-05-20 12:04:08,358 - 
So I have read Avatar: Adapt or Die today and I had some
thoughts about it in regards to the Avatar lore. I strongly
suspected that this comic would feature Sylwanin and that it would
address some of the past content that featured her, namely the
Mobile/iOS game, which had some interesting plot points in it to
say the least. I'm going to go over why I think this game has been
retconned from canoninity.

Here is the timeline of the Avatar universe in regards to Grace
as follows.

Grace has been on Pandora for 15 years. She says that
she put 10 years of her life into the schoolhouse, meaning
she had been on Pandora for 5 years at the time of
Avatar: Adapt or Die.
Where this gets interesting is that at the start of the comic,
it says, over a decade after t…

2022-05-20 12:04:08,375 - 
I recently managed to get my hands on the Nintendo Power Issue

came upon this nugget of info that on the Nintendo DSi enhanced
version Nok can get a new character model when completing a bonus
mission with the DSi enhanced mode. Does any fans own this version
of the game, would love to see this outfit.

The Avatar Problem

2022-05-20 12:04:08,377 - 
I decided to make a post about this for no other reason than to
have it addressed, as I find it very interesting. Discussion
welcomed and encouraged.
There are two given explanations for how the avatars in the
Avatar universe are created in the first place, both of
which pretty starkly contradict each other.

The first is the one we hear and see used in the film and most
other canon material. "They grow them from human DNA mixed with
the DNA of the natives". This explanation presumes that
scientists literally mix the DNA of humans with the DNA of Na'vi to
create a hybrid creature - and thusly avatars are most commonly
referred to as "hybrids". Some genetic manipulation is involved in
the process but this method asserts that avatars have a

I'm a big fan of the first season -- it focused on George Lucas

far.

I assume you're having fun with my previous post, "my Ideas as

it.
so far, I've got one of the Character sheets already made, and
that leads to an interesting question, why am I making them?
it's simple, I keep a copy of all character sheets and how they
interact, that way I can put this all into a nice and neat list in
my head. I've got one player currently (looking for a group of up
to 6, max. minimum of 4). as well, for that player, I'm making the
Exosuit more details, and removing other options if I can get
around to it. I'll also do a nice little section for the
Exosuit.

contains the basic premise of the entire game. the Videogame is my
ideas for how it should be played as a videogame, including PC
interaction with NPC's, how to save, minute details all the way to
huge details.
and so, when I saw avatar, it really kickstarted my ideas. a
universal theme, with a sci-fi feel that could very well be a
Fantasy game in and of itself.

My Movie Review

2022-05-20 12:04:08,417 - 
Avatar is a movie that would explore the world of
glowing plants and animal as well as blue-skinned humanoids called
Na'vi. Glowing land plants and fungi are the most stunning element
of the film. That is what so cool about the nights if I was on
Pandora. It makes me think it would be tremendously cool for people
to have those in the backyards back on Earth, well artificially
made fake ones using solar energy. In real life, glowing plants and
fungi are mainly found underwater on Earth, but land bioluminescent
organisms is likely more common on other worlds, just like on this
world relative to Earth in this film. The world I'm talking about
is Pandora, which is actually a moon that orbits around a gas

Na'vi Written Language

I've seen this concept art related to Avatar movie several
times, but for some reason I've dismissed it as fan art, and never
paid much attention to it. Eventually I was able to find such an
image with the Weta watermark, which raised it to official status.
But I still dismissed it as a abandoned concept, since the Na'vi
Language page tells us that they have no written language.

But in my latest re-watch of Avatar, I noticed this concept image
inside the Old School House. As shown on the right image. Does this
mean that the Na'vi have some kind of rudimentary symbol system
(pictographs) predating the writing system?

heading into production! ComingSoon.net reports that principal
photography for Avatar 2 is set to begin sometime this April, once
again in New Zealand. James Cameron will of course direct, from a
script by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and all the main characters
are to be reprised by the original stars - Sam Worthington, Zoe
Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang. No official release
date has been set thus far, but there is confirmation that three
sequels continues to be the plan for the franchise. What are your
thoughts on this development? Are you optimistic that the wait will
finally be over sooner than later?

What is perhaps rather eerie is that in his last interview in

Soundcloud Navi Language Pronunciation Guide

2022-05-20 12:04:08,481 - 
Just noticed this start appearing on Soundcloud-
https://soundcloud.com/thesoundsofpandora
Its a channel called 'the sounds of pandora' which launched just
a week ago, and the official facebook page linked to it today. It
sounds like Paul Frommer perhaps? We should probably see about
integrating that into our navi language page. On an unrelated
bonus, it seems the 'album art' they assign to each word
occasionally feature concepts rather than just shots from the film-
check out their one for 'lake'. Who knows what goodies might emerge
from that channel.

Joe Letteri Says Avatar Sequels Are The Most Ambitious Projects They've Worked On

2022-05-20 12:04:08,485 - 
It's been five long years since Avatar wowed audiences
all around the world. Unfortunately, we still have to wait till
2016 to get the first of three planned sequels. Sounds like a long
time? Don't panic! The closer we are to the release, the more
production details we get! The hyping and build-up makes the
experience even more exciting.
Now, WETA's Digital Joe Letteri has opened up a little bit on
what he considers the biggest challenge the studio has ever had:
the Avatar sequels. Not only are they pushing the boundaries in
terms of technology (again), they are creating the most detailed
universe they can to achieve an unparalleled level of realism.
Exciting things are coming!

2022-05-20 12:04:08,493 - 
I am new here. I just discovered this wiki yesterday, and I have
found lots of interesting information so far. I have the movie on
my Kindle Fire, and I swear I've watched it at least 100 times
since "the incident." That was when my six-year-old sister found my
Kindle and could not get past the lock screen due to my passcode.
She did a FACTORY RESET on it and everything was gone. Game saves,
pictures, music, videos, and even my precious Minecraft PE worlds.
After that, I re-downloaded everything, and bought Avatar as a
bonus. That was about 6 months ago. Back on topic, I beat my XBox
360 copy of the game after LOTS of confusion about what I was
supposed to do one one particular level where i looked it up and I
somehow overlooked an obvious…

Remember that photograph of the old school house on the fridge?
I noticed the official avatar facebook page posted a much better
quality version of part of it, so I've been able to use that
material and put together an enhanced copy of the full
photograph.

This was a great film

2022-05-20 12:04:08,499 - 
This film innovates science fiction and how to make it more
entertaining. The effects are grandeur which can really catch the
attention and interest of viewers. It was a very satisfying moment
wathcing it and I hope another film like this will be
created.

Avatar Pinball Machines

2022-05-20 12:04:08,500 - 
One summer's day I wandered into a cinema in the french alps,
and found this gem gathering dust in the corner... An Avatar themed
pinball machine! When I have some more time (I actually have a job
now!) I will make it a proper article. I think it was manufactured
by Stern, and from six or so playthroughs I can say it was a pretty
tough machine. They have a multiball trigger underneath the AMP
model, which can only be hit by first destroying the barrier in
front. I have a couple of videos of myself failing admirably at
it... Nice little arcade hidden there anyway. In case anyone
wanders that way, it was the Decavision cinema in the french town
of Annecy. I was there for the animation festival, it was just cool
to stumble across a piece of …

Sigourney Weaver to play a new character in 'Avatar' sequels

2022-05-20 12:04:08,503 - 
Hi, guys! I haven't been on in a long time and I do miss the
community a lot and hope to return when the new Avatar films
are out. Anyways... In addition to just checking in, I thought I
would post an article that I found regarding the future
of Sigourney Weaver's character Grace in the future
films. Apparently, she won't be reprising her role as Grace, but
rather, she will be playing an entirely new character, who many
believe will be a Na'vi. The Hollywood Reporter
was able to get a statement from James Cameron himself on
Weaver's role in the sequels. Apparently he had this to say:

What do you guys think? Are you guys glad they are not
resurrecting Grace, or do you wish Sigourney Weaver would reprise
her role as Grace instead of returning as…

Help tracking down an image

2022-05-20 12:04:08,506 - 
Hey. So, when i went to go see Avatar at the cinema when it
first came out, there was an promotional image that caught my eye.
It was of two navi standing in the forest at night, and in the sky
was one of those helicopters from the film. I'm not sure, but i
think that apart from the helicopter the sky was empty: You couldnt
see a moon or anything.
Awful description, i know? Yeah. Problem is, apart from on those
promotional items, i never saw that image again, so i cant even
remember it that well. To top it off, i've searched for it a couple
of times, and have failed to find it.
So, anyone know the image i'm talking about and happen to have a
link? I'm thinking it could make a pretty good
background :)

earlier.http://uk.eonline.com/news/499570/zoe-saldana-and-sam-worthington-sign-on-for-three-avatar-sequels

Stephen Lang confirmed for the three Sequels

Hot on the heels of the AH-nuld rumours Cameron just confirmed
it would be stephen lang again.
"Steven was so memorable in the first film, we’re privileged to
have him back,” Cameron said. “I’m not going to say exactly how
we’re bringing him back, but it’s a science fiction story, after
all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across
the arc of our new three-film saga. I really look forward to
working with such a gifted actor, who’s also become a good
friend."

http://www.deadline.com/2013/10/james-cameron-has-found-avatars-darth-vader-its-stephen-lang/
On top of that, he mentioned a "new three film saga", further
pointing that this is a sequel trilogy we are looking at rather
than two sequels and a prequel.

First look at Avatar Land in Disney World, Florida

As you may know from earlier articles, Lightstorm and Disney
partnered to build an Avatar-themed area with several attractions
in Disney World Florida's Animal Kingdom. There are several
updates, including some concept images of planned attractions.
The currently projected opening date is sometime in 2017. There
are four attractions that are pretty much confirmed:

A water ride showcasing Pandora's native fauna and flora
A flying simulator, where guests can “discover what it feels
like to soar into the sky riding a Banshee”
A walk through a bioluminescent jungle
The existing “Tree of Life” will be redecorated to look more
like Hometree

Good news for those who are still waiting for the Avatar novel
that we were promised about three years ago. James Cameron has not
forgotten about it. As you may have read here, James Cameron hired
four screenwriters for the upcoming three films.
He now also hired sci-fi author Steven Charles Gould to write
not one but four stand-alone Avatar novels. Gould has written eight
novels so far. His best known novel is Jumper which was made
into a film of the same name in 2008. He is president of the
Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, an
association of professional sci-fi and fantasy authors with about
1800 members.

of the shining lights in contemporary science fiction, and I’ve

The Mobile/iOS Game May Be Retconned

2022-05-20 12:15:09,009 - 
So I have read Avatar: Adapt or Die today and I had some
thoughts about it in regards to the Avatar lore. I strongly
suspected that this comic would feature Sylwanin and that it would
address some of the past content that featured her, namely the
Mobile/iOS game, which had some interesting plot points in it to
say the least. I'm going to go over why I think this game has been
retconned from canoninity.

Here is the timeline of the Avatar universe in regards to Grace
as follows.

Grace has been on Pandora for 15 years. She says that
she put 10 years of her life into the schoolhouse, meaning
she had been on Pandora for 5 years at the time of
Avatar: Adapt or Die.
Where this gets interesting is that at the start of the comic,
it says, over a decade after t…

2022-05-20 12:15:09,018 - 
I recently managed to get my hands on the Nintendo Power Issue
246. There's an article about James Cameron's Avatar games there. I
came upon this nugget of info that on the Nintendo DSi enhanced
version Nok can get a new character model when completing a bonus
mission with the DSi enhanced mode. Does any fans own this version
of the game, would love to see this outfit.

The Avatar Problem

2022-05-20 12:15:09,021 - 
I decided to make a post about this for no other reason than to
have it addressed, as I find it very interesting. Discussion
welcomed and encouraged.
There are two given explanations for how the avatars in the
Avatar universe are created in the first place, both of
which pretty starkly contradict each other.

The first is the one we hear and see used in the film and most
other canon material. "They grow them from human DNA mixed with
the DNA of the natives". This explanation presumes that
scientists literally mix the DNA of humans with the DNA of Na'vi to
create a hybrid creature - and thusly avatars are most commonly
referred to as "hybrids". Some genetic manipulation is involved in
the process but this method asserts that avatars have a

I'm a big fan of the first season -- it focused on George Lucas

far.

I assume you're having fun with my previous post, "my Ideas as

it.
so far, I've got one of the Character sheets already made, and
that leads to an interesting question, why am I making them?
it's simple, I keep a copy of all character sheets and how they
interact, that way I can put this all into a nice and neat list in
my head. I've got one player currently (looking for a group of up
to 6, max. minimum of 4). as well, for that player, I'm making the
Exosuit more details, and removing other options if I can get
around to it. I'll also do a nice little section for the
Exosuit.

taking movies, games, and general ideas floating through my head,

tabletop, story. the Story is always the most important part, as it
contains the basic premise of the entire game. the Videogame is my
ideas for how it should be played as a videogame, including PC
interaction with NPC's, how to save, minute details all the way to
huge details.
and so, when I saw avatar, it really kickstarted my ideas. a
universal theme, with a sci-fi feel that could very well be a
Fantasy game in and of itself.

My Movie Review

2022-05-20 12:15:09,053 - 
Avatar is a movie that would explore the world of
glowing plants and animal as well as blue-skinned humanoids called
Na'vi. Glowing land plants and fungi are the most stunning element
of the film. That is what so cool about the nights if I was on
Pandora. It makes me think it would be tremendously cool for people
to have those in the backyards back on Earth, well artificially
made fake ones using solar energy. In real life, glowing plants and
fungi are mainly found underwater on Earth, but land bioluminescent
organisms is likely more common on other worlds, just like on this
world relative to Earth in this film. The world I'm talking about
is Pandora, which is actually a moon that orbits around a gas

Na'vi Written Language

I've seen this concept art related to Avatar movie several
times, but for some reason I've dismissed it as fan art, and never
paid much attention to it. Eventually I was able to find such an
image with the Weta watermark, which raised it to official status.
But I still dismissed it as a abandoned concept, since the Na'vi
Language page tells us that they have no written language.

But in my latest re-watch of Avatar, I noticed this concept image
inside the Old School House. As shown on the right image. Does this
mean that the Na'vi have some kind of rudimentary symbol system
(pictographs) predating the writing system?

It appears the long-awaited sequel to 2009's Avatar is *finally*
heading into production! ComingSoon.net reports that principal
photography for Avatar 2 is set to begin sometime this April, once
again in New Zealand. James Cameron will of course direct, from a
script by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and all the main characters
are to be reprised by the original stars - Sam Worthington, Zoe
Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang. No official release
date has been set thus far, but there is confirmation that three
sequels continues to be the plan for the franchise. What are your
thoughts on this development? Are you optimistic that the wait will
finally be over sooner than later?

Ever since the Ubi shut down the game servers, I've searched for

the code it says you need to connected to the server to see them,
since it's user-based, or something like that. Is there a way to
tell to the game I'm connected, while in reality I'm not. But it
seems that since it's considered a bad game by the majority, the
hackers and crackers are not interested in it also.
The unlocks were the following:

Sad indeed. An unexpected accident in California; James Horner
died in a plane crash. He was alone in a small private aircraft;
and was a trained pilot. He was 61.

What is perhaps rather eerie is that in his last interview in
April, when asked about his continued involvement with the
franchise he said "If I last that long".[1]
A great shame in any case; he will be missed by many.

been delayed until 2017. I hope to edit more frequently once the
new film comes out; I do really miss the people from the community
and the whole atmosphere because it's truly incredible. My
involvement with Wikia started with this Wiki, and I'm still so
thankful to be a part of this community. It's good to be back!
First of all, I have to say that I
watched Avatar for the first time in a long time last
night, and it was truly incredible. Being able to delve back into
that world and re-experience every aspect of it was incredible and
it brought back a lot of memories; even though it's my favorite
movie ever, I …

Long Lost Avatar Game we missed!

2022-05-20 12:15:09,111 - 
Hey folks. While doing some digging to find information about
AVTR Advanced Team I discovered that another flash game was made at
the time under the title Pandora ROVR, a sort of Myst-esque rover
simulator. We totally missed it! It was done with McDonalds and the
site is down (its been like five years), but i came across a
back-up on someone's art portfolio website!
http://work.akqa.com/mcdonalds/avatar/site/
I believe the game was launched on Dec 11 2009, at the same time
as the other flash game. Notably, each time you investigate an item
it adds a log to the 'notes section', which quickly becomes
somewhat of a wiki itself. There is a wealth of information in
there for the site. I have also made a local back-up of the opening
(CG) cutscene. …

the bioluminescent flora they created:

Soundcloud Navi Language Pronunciation Guide

2022-05-20 12:15:09,118 - 
Just noticed this start appearing on Soundcloud-
https://soundcloud.com/thesoundsofpandora
Its a channel called 'the sounds of pandora' which launched just
a week ago, and the official facebook page linked to it today. It
sounds like Paul Frommer perhaps? We should probably see about
integrating that into our navi language page. On an unrelated
bonus, it seems the 'album art' they assign to each word
occasionally feature concepts rather than just shots from the film-
check out their one for 'lake'. Who knows what goodies might emerge
from that channel.

Joe Letteri Says Avatar Sequels Are The Most Ambitious Projects They've Worked On

2022-05-20 12:15:09,121 - 
It's been five long years since Avatar wowed audiences
all around the world. Unfortunately, we still have to wait till
2016 to get the first of three planned sequels. Sounds like a long
time? Don't panic! The closer we are to the release, the more
production details we get! The hyping and build-up makes the
experience even more exciting.
Now, WETA's Digital Joe Letteri has opened up a little bit on
what he considers the biggest challenge the studio has ever had:
the Avatar sequels. Not only are they pushing the boundaries in
terms of technology (again), they are creating the most detailed
universe they can to achieve an unparalleled level of realism.
Exciting things are coming!

I am new here. I just discovered this wiki yesterday, and I have
found lots of interesting information so far. I have the movie on
my Kindle Fire, and I swear I've watched it at least 100 times
since "the incident." That was when my six-year-old sister found my
Kindle and could not get past the lock screen due to my passcode.
She did a FACTORY RESET on it and everything was gone. Game saves,
pictures, music, videos, and even my precious Minecraft PE worlds.
After that, I re-downloaded everything, and bought Avatar as a
bonus. That was about 6 months ago. Back on topic, I beat my XBox
360 copy of the game after LOTS of confusion about what I was
supposed to do one one particular level where i looked it up and I
somehow overlooked an obvious…

I noticed the official avatar facebook page posted a much better

This film innovates science fiction and how to make it more

wathcing it and I hope another film like this will be

Avatar Pinball Machines

2022-05-20 12:15:09,133 - 
One summer's day I wandered into a cinema in the french alps,
and found this gem gathering dust in the corner... An Avatar themed
pinball machine! When I have some more time (I actually have a job
now!) I will make it a proper article. I think it was manufactured
by Stern, and from six or so playthroughs I can say it was a pretty
tough machine. They have a multiball trigger underneath the AMP
model, which can only be hit by first destroying the barrier in
front. I have a couple of videos of myself failing admirably at
it... Nice little arcade hidden there anyway. In case anyone
wanders that way, it was the Decavision cinema in the french town
of Annecy. I was there for the animation festival, it was just cool
to stumble across a piece of …

Sigourney Weaver to play a new character in 'Avatar' sequels

Hi, guys! I haven't been on in a long time and I do miss the
community a lot and hope to return when the new Avatar films
are out. Anyways... In addition to just checking in, I thought I
would post an article that I found regarding the future
of Sigourney Weaver's character Grace in the future
films. Apparently, she won't be reprising her role as Grace, but
rather, she will be playing an entirely new character, who many
believe will be a Na'vi. The Hollywood Reporter
was able to get a statement from James Cameron himself on
Weaver's role in the sequels. Apparently he had this to say:

What do you guys think? Are you guys glad they are not
resurrecting Grace, or do you wish Sigourney Weaver would reprise
her role as Grace instead of returning as…

Help tracking down an image

2022-05-20 12:15:09,139 - 
Hey. So, when i went to go see Avatar at the cinema when it
first came out, there was an promotional image that caught my eye.
It was of two navi standing in the forest at night, and in the sky
was one of those helicopters from the film. I'm not sure, but i
think that apart from the helicopter the sky was empty: You couldnt
see a moon or anything.
Awful description, i know? Yeah. Problem is, apart from on those
promotional items, i never saw that image again, so i cant even
remember it that well. To top it off, i've searched for it a couple
of times, and have failed to find it.
So, anyone know the image i'm talking about and happen to have a
link? I'm thinking it could make a pretty good
background :)

Hot on the heels of the AH-nuld rumours Cameron just confirmed
it would be stephen lang again.
"Steven was so memorable in the first film, we’re privileged to
have him back,” Cameron said. “I’m not going to say exactly how
we’re bringing him back, but it’s a science fiction story, after
all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across
the arc of our new three-film saga. I really look forward to
working with such a gifted actor, who’s also become a good
friend."

On top of that, he mentioned a "new three film saga", further
pointing that this is a sequel trilogy we are looking at rather
than two sequels and a prequel.

in Disney World Florida's Animal Kingdom. There are several
updates, including some concept images of planned attractions.
The currently projected opening date is sometime in 2017. There
are four attractions that are pretty much confirmed:

A water ride showcasing Pandora's native fauna and flora
A flying simulator, where guests can “discover what it feels
like to soar into the sky riding a Banshee”
A walk through a bioluminescent jungle
The existing “Tree of Life” will be redecorated to look more
like Hometree

He now also hired sci-fi author Steven Charles Gould to write
not one but four stand-alone Avatar novels. Gould has written eight
novels so far. His best known novel is Jumper which was made
into a film of the same name in 2008. He is president of the

The Mobile/iOS Game May Be Retconned

2022-05-20 12:38:29,506 - 
So I have read Avatar: Adapt or Die today and I had some
thoughts about it in regards to the Avatar lore. I strongly
suspected that this comic would feature Sylwanin and that it would
address some of the past content that featured her, namely the
Mobile/iOS game, which had some interesting plot points in it to
say the least. I'm going to go over why I think this game has been
retconned from canoninity.

Here is the timeline of the Avatar universe in regards to Grace
as follows.

Grace has been on Pandora for 15 years. She says that
she put 10 years of her life into the schoolhouse, meaning
she had been on Pandora for 5 years at the time of
Avatar: Adapt or Die.
Where this gets interesting is that at the start of the comic,
it says, over a decade after t…

2022-05-20 12:38:29,510 - 
I recently managed to get my hands on the Nintendo Power Issue
246. There's an article about James Cameron's Avatar games there. I
came upon this nugget of info that on the Nintendo DSi enhanced
version Nok can get a new character model when completing a bonus
mission with the DSi enhanced mode. Does any fans own this version
of the game, would love to see this outfit.

The Avatar Problem

2022-05-20 12:38:29,513 - 
I decided to make a post about this for no other reason than to
have it addressed, as I find it very interesting. Discussion
welcomed and encouraged.
There are two given explanations for how the avatars in the
Avatar universe are created in the first place, both of
which pretty starkly contradict each other.

The first is the one we hear and see used in the film and most
other canon material. "They grow them from human DNA mixed with
the DNA of the natives". This explanation presumes that
scientists literally mix the DNA of humans with the DNA of Na'vi to
create a hybrid creature - and thusly avatars are most commonly
referred to as "hybrids". Some genetic manipulation is involved in
the process but this method asserts that avatars have a

and master of technical innovation.
I'm a big fan of the first season -- it focused on George Lucas

far.

I assume you're having fun with my previous post, "my Ideas as

it.
so far, I've got one of the Character sheets already made, and
that leads to an interesting question, why am I making them?
it's simple, I keep a copy of all character sheets and how they
interact, that way I can put this all into a nice and neat list in
my head. I've got one player currently (looking for a group of up
to 6, max. minimum of 4). as well, for that player, I'm making the
Exosuit more details, and removing other options if I can get
around to it. I'll also do a nice little section for the
Exosuit.

I am Reaper, and I am a general creator. specifically, I love
taking movies, games, and general ideas floating through my head,
and then consider them in three frames of mind. videogame,
tabletop, story. the Story is always the most important part, as it
contains the basic premise of the entire game. the Videogame is my
ideas for how it should be played as a videogame, including PC
interaction with NPC's, how to save, minute details all the way to
huge details.
and so, when I saw avatar, it really kickstarted my ideas. a
universal theme, with a sci-fi feel that could very well be a
Fantasy game in and of itself.

My Movie Review

2022-05-20 12:38:29,549 - 
Avatar is a movie that would explore the world of
glowing plants and animal as well as blue-skinned humanoids called
Na'vi. Glowing land plants and fungi are the most stunning element
of the film. That is what so cool about the nights if I was on
Pandora. It makes me think it would be tremendously cool for people
to have those in the backyards back on Earth, well artificially
made fake ones using solar energy. In real life, glowing plants and
fungi are mainly found underwater on Earth, but land bioluminescent
organisms is likely more common on other worlds, just like on this
world relative to Earth in this film. The world I'm talking about
is Pandora, which is actually a moon that orbits around a gas

Na'vi Written Language

2022-05-20 12:38:29,557 - 
I've seen this concept art related to Avatar movie several
times, but for some reason I've dismissed it as fan art, and never
paid much attention to it. Eventually I was able to find such an
image with the Weta watermark, which raised it to official status.
But I still dismissed it as a abandoned concept, since the Na'vi
Language page tells us that they have no written language.

But in my latest re-watch of Avatar, I noticed this concept image
inside the Old School House. As shown on the right image. Does this
mean that the Na'vi have some kind of rudimentary symbol system
(pictographs) predating the writing system?

It appears the long-awaited sequel to 2009's Avatar is *finally*
heading into production! ComingSoon.net reports that principal
photography for Avatar 2 is set to begin sometime this April, once
again in New Zealand. James Cameron will of course direct, from a
script by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and all the main characters
are to be reprised by the original stars - Sam Worthington, Zoe
Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang. No official release
date has been set thus far, but there is confirmation that three
sequels continues to be the plan for the franchise. What are your
thoughts on this development? Are you optimistic that the wait will
finally be over sooner than later?

Ever since the Ubi shut down the game servers, I've searched for
info on how to get access to the unlocked weapons and armors we

the code it says you need to connected to the server to see them,
since it's user-based, or something like that. Is there a way to
tell to the game I'm connected, while in reality I'm not. But it
seems that since it's considered a bad game by the majority, the
hackers and crackers are not interested in it also.
The unlocks were the following:

franchise he said "If I last that long".[1]
A great shame in any case; he will be missed by many.

Hey folks. Just found out that this had been released; there was

with our article, one of the store pages and then various articles
from January unveiling it. It's free to play, but incompatible with
my tablet; if someone could go check it out that would be
wonderful.

We only had rumours up till this point, but it looks like James
Horner is here to stay.
http://www.slashfilm.com/james-cameron-more-avatar-sequels/
His exact words were 'if I last that long', so it looks like he
intends to stay with the franchise for the forseeable future. I
wouldn't be surprised if he is wondering how long the full
franchise is going to take.

https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/toruk/pandora?explore
This thing just launched, it is an interactive website that lets
you 'explore' Pandora. It has its own pseudo-wiki, and it is chock
full of information on the Omaticaya, Tipani, Tawkami, and Anurai
clans, and even a new one named the Kekunan Clan who are known for
their skilled banshee riders. Each of the five clans are given
runic symbols and some surrounding info. Kekunan might be the
proper name for the Eastern Sea People; it is kinda ambiguous atm.
Regardless it goes way down into several artefacts; it looks like
Neytiri's flight mask is in fact Kekunan in origin, as is the gear
Jake wears during the final confrontation. Whoever made the website

Hi, guys! I haven't been on here in a while! It's kind of sad to
see that the community isn't as active being that the new film has
been delayed until 2017. I hope to edit more frequently once the
new film comes out; I do really miss the people from the community

thankful to be a part of this community. It's good to be back!
First of all, I have to say that I

Long Lost Avatar Game we missed!

2022-05-20 12:38:29,582 - 
Hey folks. While doing some digging to find information about
AVTR Advanced Team I discovered that another flash game was made at
the time under the title Pandora ROVR, a sort of Myst-esque rover
simulator. We totally missed it! It was done with McDonalds and the
site is down (its been like five years), but i came across a
back-up on someone's art portfolio website!
http://work.akqa.com/mcdonalds/avatar/site/
I believe the game was launched on Dec 11 2009, at the same time
as the other flash game. Notably, each time you investigate an item
it adds a log to the 'notes section', which quickly becomes
somewhat of a wiki itself. There is a wealth of information in
there for the site. I have also made a local back-up of the opening
(CG) cutscene. …

Soundcloud Navi Language Pronunciation Guide

2022-05-20 12:38:29,589 - 
Just noticed this start appearing on Soundcloud-
https://soundcloud.com/thesoundsofpandora
Its a channel called 'the sounds of pandora' which launched just
a week ago, and the official facebook page linked to it today. It
sounds like Paul Frommer perhaps? We should probably see about
integrating that into our navi language page. On an unrelated
bonus, it seems the 'album art' they assign to each word
occasionally feature concepts rather than just shots from the film-
check out their one for 'lake'. Who knows what goodies might emerge
from that channel.

Joe Letteri Says Avatar Sequels Are The Most Ambitious Projects They've Worked On

2022-05-20 12:38:29,593 - 
It's been five long years since Avatar wowed audiences
all around the world. Unfortunately, we still have to wait till
2016 to get the first of three planned sequels. Sounds like a long
time? Don't panic! The closer we are to the release, the more
production details we get! The hyping and build-up makes the
experience even more exciting.
Now, WETA's Digital Joe Letteri has opened up a little bit on
what he considers the biggest challenge the studio has ever had:
the Avatar sequels. Not only are they pushing the boundaries in
terms of technology (again), they are creating the most detailed
universe they can to achieve an unparalleled level of realism.
Exciting things are coming!

I am new here. I just discovered this wiki yesterday, and I have

my Kindle Fire, and I swear I've watched it at least 100 times
since "the incident." That was when my six-year-old sister found my
Kindle and could not get past the lock screen due to my passcode.
She did a FACTORY RESET on it and everything was gone. Game saves,
pictures, music, videos, and even my precious Minecraft PE worlds.
After that, I re-downloaded everything, and bought Avatar as a
bonus. That was about 6 months ago. Back on topic, I beat my XBox
360 copy of the game after LOTS of confusion about what I was
supposed to do one one particular level where i looked it up and I

and found this gem gathering dust in the corner... An Avatar themed
pinball machine! When I have some more time (I actually have a job
now!) I will make it a proper article. I think it was manufactured
by Stern, and from six or so playthroughs I can say it was a pretty
tough machine. They have a multiball trigger underneath the AMP
model, which can only be hit by first destroying the barrier in
front. I have a couple of videos of myself failing admirably at
it... Nice little arcade hidden there anyway. In case anyone
wanders that way, it was the Decavision cinema in the french town
of Annecy. I was there for the animation festival, it was just cool

Sigourney Weaver to play a new character in 'Avatar' sequels

of Sigourney Weaver's character Grace in the future
films. Apparently, she won't be reprising her role as Grace, but
rather, she will be playing an entirely new character, who many
believe will be a Na'vi. The Hollywood Reporter
was able to get a statement from James Cameron himself on
Weaver's role in the sequels. Apparently he had this to say:

What do you guys think? Are you guys glad they are not
resurrecting Grace, or do you wish Sigourney Weaver would reprise
her role as Grace instead of returning as…

Help tracking down an image

2022-05-20 12:38:29,636 - 
Hey. So, when i went to go see Avatar at the cinema when it
first came out, there was an promotional image that caught my eye.
It was of two navi standing in the forest at night, and in the sky
was one of those helicopters from the film. I'm not sure, but i
think that apart from the helicopter the sky was empty: You couldnt
see a moon or anything.
Awful description, i know? Yeah. Problem is, apart from on those
promotional items, i never saw that image again, so i cant even
remember it that well. To top it off, i've searched for it a couple
of times, and have failed to find it.
So, anyone know the image i'm talking about and happen to have a
link? I'm thinking it could make a pretty good
background :)

"Steven was so memorable in the first film, we’re privileged to
have him back,” Cameron said. “I’m not going to say exactly how
we’re bringing him back, but it’s a science fiction story, after
all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across
the arc of our new three-film saga. I really look forward to
working with such a gifted actor, who’s also become a good
friend."

A water ride showcasing Pandora's native fauna and flora
A flying simulator, where guests can “discover what it feels
like to soar into the sky riding a Banshee”

The Mobile/iOS Game May Be Retconned

2022-05-20 16:15:19,988 - 
So I have read Avatar: Adapt or Die today and I had some
thoughts about it in regards to the Avatar lore. I strongly
suspected that this comic would feature Sylwanin and that it would
address some of the past content that featured her, namely the
Mobile/iOS game, which had some interesting plot points in it to
say the least. I'm going to go over why I think this game has been
retconned from canoninity.

Here is the timeline of the Avatar universe in regards to Grace
as follows.

Grace has been on Pandora for 15 years. She says that
she put 10 years of her life into the schoolhouse, meaning
she had been on Pandora for 5 years at the time of
Avatar: Adapt or Die.
Where this gets interesting is that at the start of the comic,
it says, over a decade after t…

Avatar on the Nintendo DSi

2022-05-20 16:15:20,004 - 
I recently managed to get my hands on the Nintendo Power Issue
246. There's an article about James Cameron's Avatar games there. I
came upon this nugget of info that on the Nintendo DSi enhanced
version Nok can get a new character model when completing a bonus
mission with the DSi enhanced mode. Does any fans own this version
of the game, would love to see this outfit.

The Avatar Problem

2022-05-20 16:15:20,004 - 
I decided to make a post about this for no other reason than to
have it addressed, as I find it very interesting. Discussion
welcomed and encouraged.
There are two given explanations for how the avatars in the
Avatar universe are created in the first place, both of
which pretty starkly contradict each other.

The first is the one we hear and see used in the film and most
other canon material. "They grow them from human DNA mixed with
the DNA of the natives". This explanation presumes that
scientists literally mix the DNA of humans with the DNA of Na'vi to
create a hybrid creature - and thusly avatars are most commonly
referred to as "hybrids". Some genetic manipulation is involved in
the process but this method asserts that avatars have a
percen…

The Story of James Cameron - Blockbuster Podcast

2022-05-20 16:15:20,020 - 
The second season of the award-winning Blockbuster
podcast tells the story of James Cameron's rise from humble
beginnings as a delivery truck driver to prolific filmmaker
and master of technical innovation.
I'm a big fan of the first season -- it focused on George Lucas
and Stephen Spielberg -- and I'm just as impressed with Season 2 so
far. 
Thought it may be of particular interest to the Avatar Wiki
community, so here's a link to check it

I assume you're having fun with my previous post, "my Ideas as
they are now" and are looking for this new post. well, this is
it.
so far, I've got one of the Character sheets already made, and
that leads to an interesting question, why am I making them?
it's simple, I keep a copy of all character sheets and how they
interact, that way I can put this all into a nice and neat list in
my head. I've got one player currently (looking for a group of up
to 6, max. minimum of 4). as well, for that player, I'm making the
Exosuit more details, and removing other options if I can get
around to it. I'll also do a nice little section for the
Exosuit.

the human race is similar to the D&D game (the raci…

my ideas as they are now.

2022-05-20 16:15:20,035 - 
those are the words of a minorly famous quote no one has heard
of. they seem rather apt for this post.
I am Reaper, and I am a general creator. specifically, I love
taking movies, games, and general ideas floating through my head,
and then consider them in three frames of mind. videogame,
tabletop, story. the Story is always the most important part, as it
contains the basic premise of the entire game. the Videogame is my
ideas for how it should be played as a videogame, including PC
interaction with NPC's, how to save, minute details all the way to
huge details.
and so, when I saw avatar, it really kickstarted my ideas. a
universal theme, with a sci-fi feel that could very well be a
Fantasy game in and of itself.
I like stuff like that, be it…

What started my Avatat interest

2022-05-20 16:15:20,035 - 
When i first seen the avatar movie in 2019 i suddenly was
inspired by it, seeing the beautiful connections the Na'vi has with
thier planet, a both Spiritually and Neuralogicly advanced race,
which i found amazingly Beautiful just like Doctor Grace Augestine
was. Also the advanced technology the humans aka the RDA had, the
avatar movie was what officailly pulled me into loving the Sci-Fi
genre, and eventually involving other major sci fi frachises.
Im in the process of creating a RP universe composed of all my
favorite Sci-Fi movies and games along with some of my own added
stuff. It is known as the Null Alliances Universe.
My OC Angelic Wolf Covina Merovech is my primary Character used
in the story, he also has his own command ship the CES A…

My Movie Review

2022-05-20 16:15:20,051 - 
Avatar is a movie that would explore the world of
glowing plants and animal as well as blue-skinned humanoids called
Na'vi. Glowing land plants and fungi are the most stunning element
of the film. That is what so cool about the nights if I was on
Pandora. It makes me think it would be tremendously cool for people
to have those in the backyards back on Earth, well artificially
made fake ones using solar energy. In real life, glowing plants and
fungi are mainly found underwater on Earth, but land bioluminescent
organisms is likely more common on other worlds, just like on this
world relative to Earth in this film. The world I'm talking about
is Pandora, which is actually a moon that orbits around a gas
giants in the Goldilocks zone around Al…

I just noticed that Paul Frommer's blog http://naviteri.org/ is
still posting additional vocabulary and so forth for the Na'vi
language, and has been doing so consistently since 2010. It's a
fascinating subject; does anyone here speak much of the language?
I'm aware that our page on this wiki is probably missing an awful
lot of information, with those additions from Frommer.

Na'vi Written Language

2022-05-20 16:15:20,065 - 
I've seen this concept art related to Avatar movie several
times, but for some reason I've dismissed it as fan art, and never
paid much attention to it. Eventually I was able to find such an
image with the Weta watermark, which raised it to official status.
But I still dismissed it as a abandoned concept, since the Na'vi
Language page tells us that they have no written language.

But in my latest re-watch of Avatar, I noticed this concept image
inside the Old School House. As shown on the right image. Does this
mean that the Na'vi have some kind of rudimentary symbol system
(pictographs) predating the writing system?

Markings on the Weta rendering of the Eytukan bow. Markings on a
war axe from Project 880 days. And marking on the Staff of Wii…

Avatar 2 Set To Begin Filming In April

2022-05-20 16:15:20,075 - 

It appears the long-awaited sequel to 2009's Avatar is *finally*
heading into production! ComingSoon.net reports that principal
photography for Avatar 2 is set to begin sometime this April, once
again in New Zealand. James Cameron will of course direct, from a
script by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and all the main characters
are to be reprised by the original stars - Sam Worthington, Zoe
Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang. No official release
date has been set thus far, but there is confirmation that three
sequels continues to be the plan for the franchise. What are your
thoughts on this development? Are you optimistic that the wait will
finally be over sooner than later?

Ever since the Ubi shut down the game servers, I've searched for
info on how to get access to the unlocked weapons and armors we
had. I think the files should be on our computer but somewhere in
the code it says you need to connected to the server to see them,
since it's user-based, or something like that. Is there a way to
tell to the game I'm connected, while in reality I'm not. But it
seems that since it's considered a bad game by the majority, the
hackers and crackers are not interested in it also.
The unlocks were the following:

RDA: Argo Standard Issue Rifle, Dent Nail Gun, Signet Shotgun.

2022-05-20 16:15:20,080 - 
Sad indeed. An unexpected accident in California; James Horner
died in a plane crash. He was alone in a small private aircraft;
and was a trained pilot. He was 61.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33235271
What is perhaps rather eerie is that in his last interview in
April, when asked about his continued involvement with the
franchise he said "If I last that long".[1]
A great shame in any case; he will be missed by many.

His exact words were 'if I last that long', so it looks like he
intends to stay with the franchise for the forseeable future. I

Long Lost Avatar Game we missed!

2022-05-20 16:15:20,085 - 
Hey folks. While doing some digging to find information about
AVTR Advanced Team I discovered that another flash game was made at
the time under the title Pandora ROVR, a sort of Myst-esque rover
simulator. We totally missed it! It was done with McDonalds and the
site is down (its been like five years), but i came across a
back-up on someone's art portfolio website!
http://work.akqa.com/mcdonalds/avatar/site/
I believe the game was launched on Dec 11 2009, at the same time
as the other flash game. Notably, each time you investigate an item
it adds a log to the 'notes section', which quickly becomes
somewhat of a wiki itself. There is a wealth of information in
there for the site. I have also made a local back-up of the opening
(CG) cutscene. …

Its a channel called 'the sounds of pandora' which launched just
a week ago, and the official facebook page linked to it today. It
sounds like Paul Frommer perhaps? We should probably see about
integrating that into our navi language page. On an unrelated
bonus, it seems the 'album art' they assign to each word
occasionally feature concepts rather than just shots from the film-

Joe Letteri Says Avatar Sequels Are The Most Ambitious Projects They've Worked On

2022-05-20 16:15:20,109 - 
It's been five long years since Avatar wowed audiences
all around the world. Unfortunately, we still have to wait till
2016 to get the first of three planned sequels. Sounds like a long
time? Don't panic! The closer we are to the release, the more
production details we get! The hyping and build-up makes the
experience even more exciting.
Now, WETA's Digital Joe Letteri has opened up a little bit on
what he considers the biggest challenge the studio has ever had:
the Avatar sequels. Not only are they pushing the boundaries in
terms of technology (again), they are creating the most detailed
universe they can to achieve an unparalleled level of realism.
Exciting things are coming!

She did a FACTORY RESET on it and everything was gone. Game saves,
pictures, music, videos, and even my precious Minecraft PE worlds.
After that, I re-downloaded everything, and bought Avatar as a
bonus. That was about 6 months ago. Back on topic, I beat my XBox

front. I have a couple of videos of myself failing admirably at

2022-05-20 16:15:20,124 - 
Hey. So, when i went to go see Avatar at the cinema when it
first came out, there was an promotional image that caught my eye.
It was of two navi standing in the forest at night, and in the sky
was one of those helicopters from the film. I'm not sure, but i
think that apart from the helicopter the sky was empty: You couldnt
see a moon or anything.
Awful description, i know? Yeah. Problem is, apart from on those
promotional items, i never saw that image again, so i cant even
remember it that well. To top it off, i've searched for it a couple
of times, and have failed to find it.

The Mobile/iOS Game May Be Retconned

2022-05-24 12:04:16,574 - 
So I have read Avatar: Adapt or Die today and I had some
thoughts about it in regards to the Avatar lore. I strongly
suspected that this comic would feature Sylwanin and that it would
address some of the past content that featured her, namely the
Mobile/iOS game, which had some interesting plot points in it to
say the least. I'm going to go over why I think this game has been
retconned from canoninity.

Here is the timeline of the Avatar universe in regards to Grace
as follows.

Grace has been on Pandora for 15 years. She says that
she put 10 years of her life into the schoolhouse, meaning
she had been on Pandora for 5 years at the time of
Avatar: Adapt or Die.
Where this gets interesting is that at the start of the comic,
it says, over a decade after t…

Avatar on the Nintendo DSi

2022-05-24 12:04:16,576 - 
I recently managed to get my hands on the Nintendo Power Issue
246. There's an article about James Cameron's Avatar games there. I
came upon this nugget of info that on the Nintendo DSi enhanced
version Nok can get a new character model when completing a bonus
mission with the DSi enhanced mode. Does any fans own this version
of the game, would love to see this outfit.

The Avatar Problem

2022-05-24 12:04:16,579 - 
I decided to make a post about this for no other reason than to
have it addressed, as I find it very interesting. Discussion
welcomed and encouraged.
There are two given explanations for how the avatars in the
Avatar universe are created in the first place, both of
which pretty starkly contradict each other.

The first is the one we hear and see used in the film and most
other canon material. "They grow them from human DNA mixed with
the DNA of the natives". This explanation presumes that
scientists literally mix the DNA of humans with the DNA of Na'vi to
create a hybrid creature - and thusly avatars are most commonly
referred to as "hybrids". Some genetic manipulation is involved in
the process but this method asserts that avatars have a
percen…

The Story of James Cameron - Blockbuster Podcast

2022-05-24 12:04:16,585 - 
The second season of the award-winning Blockbuster
podcast tells the story of James Cameron's rise from humble
beginnings as a delivery truck driver to prolific filmmaker
and master of technical innovation.
I'm a big fan of the first season -- it focused on George Lucas
and Stephen Spielberg -- and I'm just as impressed with Season 2 so
far. 
Thought it may be of particular interest to the Avatar Wiki
community, so here's a link to check it

I assume you're having fun with my previous post, "my Ideas as
they are now" and are looking for this new post. well, this is
it.
so far, I've got one of the Character sheets already made, and
that leads to an interesting question, why am I making them?
it's simple, I keep a copy of all character sheets and how they
interact, that way I can put this all into a nice and neat list in
my head. I've got one player currently (looking for a group of up
to 6, max. minimum of 4). as well, for that player, I'm making the
Exosuit more details, and removing other options if I can get
around to it. I'll also do a nice little section for the
Exosuit.

the human race is similar to the D&D game (the raci…

my ideas as they are now.

2022-05-24 12:04:16,601 - 
those are the words of a minorly famous quote no one has heard
of. they seem rather apt for this post.
I am Reaper, and I am a general creator. specifically, I love
taking movies, games, and general ideas floating through my head,
and then consider them in three frames of mind. videogame,
tabletop, story. the Story is always the most important part, as it
contains the basic premise of the entire game. the Videogame is my
ideas for how it should be played as a videogame, including PC
interaction with NPC's, how to save, minute details all the way to
huge details.
and so, when I saw avatar, it really kickstarted my ideas. a
universal theme, with a sci-fi feel that could very well be a

What started my Avatat interest

2022-05-24 12:04:16,604 - 
When i first seen the avatar movie in 2019 i suddenly was
inspired by it, seeing the beautiful connections the Na'vi has with
thier planet, a both Spiritually and Neuralogicly advanced race,
which i found amazingly Beautiful just like Doctor Grace Augestine
was. Also the advanced technology the humans aka the RDA had, the
avatar movie was what officailly pulled me into loving the Sci-Fi
genre, and eventually involving other major sci fi frachises.
Im in the process of creating a RP universe composed of all my
favorite Sci-Fi movies and games along with some of my own added
stuff. It is known as the Null Alliances Universe.
My OC Angelic Wolf Covina Merovech is my primary Character used
in the story, he also has his own command ship the CES A…

My Movie Review

2022-05-24 12:04:16,605 - 
Avatar is a movie that would explore the world of
glowing plants and animal as well as blue-skinned humanoids called
Na'vi. Glowing land plants and fungi are the most stunning element
of the film. That is what so cool about the nights if I was on
Pandora. It makes me think it would be tremendously cool for people
to have those in the backyards back on Earth, well artificially
made fake ones using solar energy. In real life, glowing plants and
fungi are mainly found underwater on Earth, but land bioluminescent
organisms is likely more common on other worlds, just like on this
world relative to Earth in this film. The world I'm talking about
is Pandora, which is actually a moon that orbits around a gas

I just noticed that Paul Frommer's blog http://naviteri.org/ is

Na'vi Written Language

2022-05-24 12:04:16,611 - 
I've seen this concept art related to Avatar movie several
times, but for some reason I've dismissed it as fan art, and never
paid much attention to it. Eventually I was able to find such an
image with the Weta watermark, which raised it to official status.
But I still dismissed it as a abandoned concept, since the Na'vi
Language page tells us that they have no written language.

But in my latest re-watch of Avatar, I noticed this concept image
inside the Old School House. As shown on the right image. Does this
mean that the Na'vi have some kind of rudimentary symbol system
(pictographs) predating the writing system?

Markings on the Weta rendering of the Eytukan bow. Markings on a

It appears the long-awaited sequel to 2009's Avatar is *finally*
heading into production! ComingSoon.net reports that principal
photography for Avatar 2 is set to begin sometime this April, once
again in New Zealand. James Cameron will of course direct, from a
script by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and all the main characters
are to be reprised by the original stars - Sam Worthington, Zoe
Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang. No official release
date has been set thus far, but there is confirmation that three
sequels continues to be the plan for the franchise. What are your
thoughts on this development? Are you optimistic that the wait will
finally be over sooner than later?

Ever since the Ubi shut down the game servers, I've searched for
info on how to get access to the unlocked weapons and armors we
had. I think the files should be on our computer but somewhere in
the code it says you need to connected to the server to see them,
since it's user-based, or something like that. Is there a way to
tell to the game I'm connected, while in reality I'm not. But it
seems that since it's considered a bad game by the majority, the
hackers and crackers are not interested in it also.
The unlocks were the following:

Sad indeed. An unexpected accident in California; James Horner
died in a plane crash. He was alone in a small private aircraft;
and was a trained pilot. He was 61.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33235271
What is perhaps rather eerie is that in his last interview in
April, when asked about his continued involvement with the
franchise he said "If I last that long".[1]
A great shame in any case; he will be missed by many.

Hey folks. While doing some digging to find information about

simulator. We totally missed it! It was done with McDonalds and the
site is down (its been like five years), but i came across a
back-up on someone's art portfolio website!
http://work.akqa.com/mcdonalds/avatar/site/
I believe the game was launched on Dec 11 2009, at the same time
as the other flash game. Notably, each time you investigate an item
it adds a log to the 'notes section', which quickly becomes
somewhat of a wiki itself. There is a wealth of information in
there for the site. I have also made a local back-up of the opening

Joe Letteri Says Avatar Sequels Are The Most Ambitious Projects They've Worked On

2022-05-24 12:04:16,641 - 
It's been five long years since Avatar wowed audiences
all around the world. Unfortunately, we still have to wait till
2016 to get the first of three planned sequels. Sounds like a long
time? Don't panic! The closer we are to the release, the more
production details we get! The hyping and build-up makes the
experience even more exciting.
Now, WETA's Digital Joe Letteri has opened up a little bit on
what he considers the biggest challenge the studio has ever had:
the Avatar sequels. Not only are they pushing the boundaries in
terms of technology (again), they are creating the most detailed
universe they can to achieve an unparalleled level of realism.
Exciting things are coming!
